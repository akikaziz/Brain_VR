Hello!

Welcome to Brain VR!

Brain VR is a Virtual Reality model of the human brain that helps you learn about the brain in real time. You can access 141 components of the human brain, and view hierarchical information and functions for each component. This repository includes all the assets and codes necessary to run the model in Unity. The actual brain OBJ file is too big to be uploaded on here, so I have attached a link to where you can download it and convert the given brain mesh file into an OBJ file to be imported on Unity.

Have fun!
