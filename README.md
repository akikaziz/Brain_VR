Hello!

Welcome to Brain VR!

Brain VR is a Virtual Reality model of the human brain that helps you learn about the brain in real time. You can access 141 components of the human brain, and view hierarchical information and functions for each component. This repository includes all the assets and codes necessary to run the model in Unity. The actual brain OBJ file is too big to be uploaded on here, so I have attached a link to where you can download it and convert the given brain mesh file into an OBJ file to be imported on Unity.

Link to downloading Brain Mesh Files with instructions - https://community.brain-map.org/t/human-brain-atlas-mesh-files/560

Please make sure that all the files including the brain OBJ file are in the same assets folder

The model can be interacted with on Unity on the editor (Game View) mode for testing purposes or if you don't own a headset. Otherwise, there are instructions on how to use the headset on the two whiteboards when you initially load the model on your headset.

Please download and import the necessary XR Interaction packages to deploy the model on the VR headset.

Have fun!
